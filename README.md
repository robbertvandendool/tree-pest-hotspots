# tree-pest-hotspots
This repository contains the data and code necessary to reproduce the paper 'Introduction hotspots of non-native tree pests and the role of cities'. 

# Raw data and data scripts not included
The data and code are limited to the intermediate data and the analysis.  

The intermediate data has already been transformed per the transformations described in the paper. Descriptions of these variables and their units can be found in the supporting information of the paper. 

# Bias correction memory requirements
Sufficient computer memory is required to load all the citizen science data, 32 gb is recommended. Alternatively, bias correction can be applied using just the 'same genera' GBIF dataset.
